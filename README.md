# README Generator

## Description

The README Generator is a Node.js command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The motivation behind this project was to simplify the process of creating a well-structured README for developers, saving time and enhancing project documentation quality. This tool automates the inclusion of essential sections such as project title, description, installation instructions, usage, license information, and much more, ensuring that all necessary details are covered. Through this project, valuable skills were gained in Node.js, npm, modular programming, and user interaction from the command line.
